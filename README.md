"Welcome Repository"
Welcome to my first repository. This seems like a good place to store and collaberate on my open-source projects while I learn PHP and other useful languages with a view to building up a web-based programming portfolio.
My introduction to github comes from a friend of mine who designed and maintains Pjuu, well worth a look.
